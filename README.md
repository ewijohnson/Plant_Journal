# Plant Journal

## About

This project was created in Python with Django, and is a web application that allows
users to track their houseplants. It allows for tracking and making notes about
plants owned; light, water, and soil conditions; and other detailed information.

## How to View
As this application was written to require log in functionality, anyone can view 
it using the Guest log in that I have provided. 

Web Address: https://ewijohnson.pythonanywhere.com/about/
User Name: guest  
Password: plant123

The guest only has view capabilities, and cannot add, edit, or delete information 
as other user types can. This is to prevent people I don't know from adding in 
information to this copy of the application.
